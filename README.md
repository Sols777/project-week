Hi there ðŸ‘‹! I am Luis

## RaveBral(Airbnb Clone):
> This project was my first project @LeWagon Porto bootcamp in cooperation trough github with 2 other junior devs from the bootcamp.
## What is it about:
<p>
  This project was suggested as our 1st project working together , managing branches with github and deploying it to heroku.
  The idea its to create an airbnb clone that alows to list , book , search and view something. So our idea was to make that 
  something venues for raves all in many diferent citys and countries.
